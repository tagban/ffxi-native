/* The launcher's PlayOnline session: what replaces the PlayOnline Viewer's sign-in so that
 * FINAL FANTASY XI can log in on a server with PlayOnline behind it.
 *
 *   1. sqIrc sign-in on the PlayOnline IRC port (P-IRC, 51240): NOTICE AUTH -> USER (our RSA-256
 *      modulus) -> numeric 300 (the session key, RSA-wrapped) -> NICK, encrypted from there on.
 *      The server knows the member from the nick, which encodes the PlayOnline ID. The session
 *      stays open while the player plays: polpro requests are attributed to a member by which
 *      live sqIrc key decrypts them, and it is how the server reaches the member.
 *   2. polpro cmd 4 sub 5 (51220) with contents class 1: the reply's first 16 bytes are the FFXI
 *      session value V. The server issues one V per sign-in and publishes it to
 *      pol_accounts.session_value, which the lobby checks (MD5(V || K+n) in every passwd).
 *
 * Portable C11 over polnet (Winsock / BSD sockets). Blocking; one session per object. */
