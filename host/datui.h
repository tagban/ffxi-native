/* The game's own UI art, read straight from the install's DATs: images (window frames, fonts, the
 * lobby's logo and buttons), the sprite sheets that cut them up, and the window frame laid out at
 * any size. For screens host64 draws before the game runs (sign-in), in the game's look.
 *
 * A DAT is a list of chunks: name[4], u32 (type in bits 0-6, size in 16-byte units in bits 7-25),
 * 8 bytes of padding, then the payload.
 *   type 0x20, an image: u8 flag, category[8] ("menu    "), name[8], a BITMAPINFOHEADER, then
 *     DXT1/3/5 (the FourCC stored reversed, the blocks 12 bytes after it), 8-bit (a BGRA palette
 *     of 256, then indices) or 32-bit BGRA. Rows top-down. Alpha is PS2-style: 0x80 is opaque.
 *   type 0x31, a sprite sheet: name[16], u8 textures, that many category+name[16], u16 sprites;
 *     each sprite is u8 parts, and each part is 45 bytes then the category+name[16] of its image:
 *       i16 x, y per vertex (TL, TR, BL, BR), i16 uv width, height, u, v (texels, wrapping),
 *       u8 pad, RGBA per vertex (0x80 = 1.0: the lobby's buttons' 96,96,127 is the menus' blue),
 *       u8 mode[4]
 *   type 0x30, a menu layout (window positions, which sheet sprites they use): not read yet.
 *
 * Text is the game's "font/moji" (1.DAT): 16-pixel cells, 64 a row, in character-code order from
 * the space (ASCII, then more), each glyph at the left of its cell; its advance is measured here
 * from its alpha.
 *
 * Where things are (ROM/0): 1.DAT the fonts and menu icons, 2.DAT the lobby ("lobbyps2": 512x448
 * screen space, centred), 14.DAT..21.DAT window themes 1-8 ("win00"). */
