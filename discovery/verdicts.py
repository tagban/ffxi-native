# The manual verdicts, per module and per retail build. Imported by Discover2.py, Switches.py
# and BogusCheck.py (Jython), and read by tools/newbuild.py (CPython): keep it plain data, no
# Ghidra imports at module level. A build is recognised by the PE TimeDateStamp of the imported
# image, which the POL1 unpacker keeps from the retail DLL; the module by the image's name
# (FFXiMain.unpacked.dll -> 'ffximain', FFXi.unpacked.dll -> 'ffxi').
#
# The verdicts for a new build are the previous build's, carried over with an address map (a byte
# window around each old address, relocated dwords wildcarded, must match exactly once in the new
# .text: `tools/newbuild.py carry`) and then re-checked by the pipeline itself:
# Conflicts/BogusCheck/SwitchAudit report anything the carried-over lists miss. See the build's
# discovery notes (discovery/notes/).
