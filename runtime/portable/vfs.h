/* Guest paths (R3): the guest always sees Windows paths ("C:\Program Files (x86)\PlayOnline\...",
 * relative paths, "FINAL FANTASY XI//FTABLE.DAT" with a doubled separator, "/" or "\"). vfs
 * keeps the guest's current directory itself - the host's is never consulted - normalises every
 * path to an absolute Windows form, and maps it to a host path through a mount table:
 *   Windows x64: no mounts needed; the normalised path is the host path.
 *   macOS: the player's copied install mounted where the retail installer put it, e.g.
 *          "C:\Program Files (x86)\PlayOnline" -> "/Users/x/Library/Application Support/FFXI/PlayOnline".
 * Guest strings are code page 1252 (k32.c); host paths are UTF-8. */
