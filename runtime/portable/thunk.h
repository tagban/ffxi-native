/* Imports on 64-bit hosts (R3): every Win32 function the game can reach - through its import
 * table or GetProcAddress - gets a synthetic guest address in a range that is never mapped. The
 * game calls it like any function pointer; rt_call_indirect finds no translation there and hands
 * it to thunk_dispatch, which runs the shim registered for that name. A shim knows its
 * signature: it reads its arguments off the guest stack and pops them itself (stdcall).
 *
 * An import with no shim still gets an address, and traps with its name on first call - the list
 * of shims to write grows from real runs, as it did for the R3.0 boundary trace. */
